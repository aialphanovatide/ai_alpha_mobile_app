Over the past 220 days, Bitcoin has swung by 20% or more a staggering eleven times. The average swing? A whopping 25%. That’s like waking up every couple of weeks to find your portfolio has taken a rollercoaster ride with no seatbelt. For crypto die-hards, it’s all part of the game. For others, it’s a constant test of nerves.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So, why is Bitcoin—now over a decade old and increasingly mainstream—still behaving like it’s in the Wild West of finance? Let’s dive in.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Data: Eleven 20% Swings, and Counting</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In just 220 days, Bitcoin has swung by 20% or more eleven times, with each swing averaging 25%. Even by Bitcoin standards, that’s pretty extreme. These aren’t your average market bumps—they’re dramatic price moves that keep both traders and long-term investors guessing. It’s as if every few weeks, the market decides to hit reset, testing everyone’s conviction.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What’s Driving Bitcoin’s Chaos?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The big question: why is Bitcoin still this volatile? Let’s break down the usual suspects:</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Macroeconomic Mayhem: Rising inflation, central bank rate hikes, and recession fears are shaking up global markets, and Bitcoin hasn’t escaped the turbulence.</span></p><ul><li class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><u>Institutional Players:</u></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Bitcoin isn’t just for retail traders anymore. Hedge funds and asset managers are in the mix, bringing more liquidity but also more volatility, as they make short-term moves based on global market trends.</span></li><li class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><u>Leverage and Liquidations:</u></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Crypto traders love leverage, and when Bitcoin moves, it triggers liquidations—positions getting automatically closed—which amplifies the swings.</span></li><li class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><u>Regulatory Uncertainty:</u></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Every time a government hints at crypto regulations (or lack thereof), the market reacts, often dramatically. One day it’s optimism, the next it’s fear.</span></li></ul><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Emotional Rollercoaster: HODL or Fold?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bitcoin’s volatility isn’t just a financial phenomenon—it’s a psychological test. For long-term holders (the HODLers), these swings are just noise. They believe in Bitcoin’s long-term promise and ride out the storm. Traders, though, live for (or die by) these swings. High returns are possible, but timing the market perfectly? Nearly impossible.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Market psychology plays a huge role here. When Bitcoin spikes, it attracts new buyers, eager not to miss out. But when it crashes back down, panic selling ensues, making the swings even wilder.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Is This Normal for Bitcoin?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yes and no. Bitcoin has always been volatile—just look back at the 2017 bull run, where massive gains were followed by gut-wrenching drops. What’s different now is the backdrop. Bitcoin has moved beyond its speculative roots and is now part of the institutional landscape. Yet, despite this, its volatility remains as wild as ever. The tension between Bitcoin as a speculative asset and its future as digital gold is what keeps the market on edge.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So, where does Bitcoin go from here? In short: volatility isn’t going anywhere. As long as the market remains a mix of speculative traders, leveraged bets, and regulatory uncertainty, these swings are here to stay. But that doesn’t mean Bitcoin is broken. For many, the volatility is part of the appeal. The chance for big returns draws traders in, while long-term believers stay focused on the bigger picture.</span></p>',

That’s changing. Enter Bitcoin Staking Oracles, a new innovation powered by RedStone and Babylon that could turn Bitcoin into an active player in decentralised finance (DeFi).&nbsp;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Imagine earning yield on your Bitcoin without having to part with it, all while bringing much-needed liquidity into the DeFi world. Sounds too good to be true? Let’s break it down.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What Exactly Are Bitcoin Staking Oracles?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In simple terms, Bitcoin Staking Oracles act as the bridge between Bitcoin’s rock-solid Proof-of-Work (PoW) security and Ethereum’s flexible, programmable DeFi world. They provide real-time data that shows every tokenized Bitcoin (LBTC) on Ethereum is backed 1:1 by real Bitcoin locked on the Bitcoin blockchain.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It’s like Ethereum’s liquid staking tokens (think Lido’s stETH), but with a twist—Bitcoin doesn’t natively support staking. That’s where RedStone and Lombard’s system comes in, creating a clever workaround. Bitcoin holders can lock up their BTC, receive LBTC on Ethereum, and use it in various DeFi protocols, from lending platforms like Morpho to yield farms like Pendle. Now, Bitcoin isn’t just sitting there—it’s working.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">How It Works: Turning Bitcoin Into DeFi Power</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Here’s the nuts and bolts. You lock up your Bitcoin through Lombard’s system, powered by Babylon. In return, you get LBTC, a tokenized version of your Bitcoin that lives on Ethereum. You can trade it, lend it, or stake it in DeFi protocols, earning yield while your Bitcoin stays securely locked away.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The challenge? Synchronising Bitcoin’s 10-minute block times with Ethereum’s faster 12-second ones. That’s where the Bitcoin Staking Oracle comes in, keeping everything in sync so that every LBTC is fully backed by real BTC. No funny business—just accurate, real-time data that ensures liquidity and prevents issues like under-collateralization.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Why Oracles Are Key: It’s All About Stability</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In DeFi, reliable oracles are like referees in sports—without them, chaos ensues. They provide up-to-the-minute price and collateral data that smart contracts use to make decisions. If your oracle messes up, the whole system can unravel—think massive liquidations or price manipulations.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For LBTC, the oracle ensures that its value stays pegged to Bitcoin, even when things get shaky. RedStone’s oracle constantly checks that each LBTC token is fully backed by Bitcoin, avoiding liquidity problems that could lead to nasty price drops or liquidation cascades.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yield-Bearing Bitcoin: The HODLer’s Dream</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Why should you care about this if you’re a Bitcoin maximalist? One word: yield. Traditionally, Bitcoin holders are long-term "hodlers," betting on Bitcoin’s eventual price appreciation. But now, with Bitcoin liquid staking, you can generate yield on your Bitcoin holdings without giving up ownership.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Instead of just watching your Bitcoin sit there, you can stake it, get LBTC, and start earning returns in DeFi. It’s like putting your money to work while still keeping your long-term investment intact. As more LBTC enters the market, Bitcoin could finally become a core part of the DeFi ecosystem, adding liquidity to both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Role of Babylon and Lombard: A Security Powerhouse</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This isn’t just about creating a DeFi-friendly Bitcoin—it’s about keeping it secure. Babylon and Lombard’s system marries Bitcoin’s robust PoW security with Ethereum’s programmable features. Babylon locks up your BTC, Lombard issues LBTC on Ethereum, and RedStone’s oracles ensure everything stays backed 1:1. It’s a hybrid model that’s hard to beat, combining Bitcoin’s resilience with Ethereum’s flexibility.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As the system matures, we might even see LBTC’s value rise above 1 BTC, similar to how stETH earns staking rewards. This could further incentivize Bitcoin holders to stake their assets and dive deeper into the DeFi world.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What’s Next: Bitcoin as a DeFi Star?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The launch of Bitcoin Staking Oracles could be a game-changer, positioning Bitcoin as more than just a store of value. Now, Bitcoin holders can participate in DeFi without giving up their precious BTC. As more DeFi platforms integrate LBTC, Bitcoin could become a key liquidity driver in the space, unlocking new opportunities for yield and capital efficiency.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For Bitcoin investors, this is an exciting development. It allows them to earn passive income on their holdings while still benefiting from Bitcoin’s security and long-term growth potential. For the DeFi space, it opens the door to a whole new world of liquidity and cross-chain interaction.</span></p>',

This time, we’re looking at a more reasonable $8.28 million in outflows, balanced by $3.06 million in inflows. The ETH/BTC ratio is up 0.54%, which sounds small but is really just Ethereum going, “Hey, I can keep up with Bitcoin… kinda.” Monday and Wednesday were dead—nothing came in or out—but Friday saw a little excitement with Grayscale dumping $8.71 million while Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund came in as the hero with $8.61 million in inflows.

It’s basically Ethereum whispering, “I’m still here, guys!” Sure, it’s outperforming Bitcoin—if you squint hard enough. But this little bump is probably thanks to all the action in Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions, which are making fees less ridiculous. So yeah, Ethereum’s holding its own, but it’s not exactly blowing Bitcoin out of the water.

After a steep fall earlier in the year, it’s been stuck in what traders call a “sideways” pattern since August, meaning the price is bouncing between resistance 1 at $0.00002290 and support 1 at $0.00001650. The tricky part? That support level is a fresh all-time low, so LDO is basically hanging on by a thread, hovering just above a major drop-off.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">LDO tried to break out of this range twice this year—once in May and again in August—but both attempts failed, and each failure built up more resistance. Now, there’s a second barrier at $0.00003072, another one at $0.00004124, and a much higher level at $0.00005470, which we haven’t seen since February. For now, though, everyone is watching those lower support levels, waiting to see if LDO holds on or drops even further.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="ql-size-large">A Deeper Technical Look</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">‣ LDO/BTC is stuck in a consolidation range, with the price bouncing between Resistance 1 at $0.00002290 and Support 1 at $0.00001650.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">‣ The price has tested Resistance 1 twice, in May and August, but failed to break through either time. Resistance 2 at $0.00003072 and Resistance 3 at $0.00004124 remain distant targets if LDO can stage a recovery.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">‣ On the flip side, Support 2 at $0.00001292 and Support 3 at $0.00000982, calculated using Fibonacci retracement, represent potential downside risks if the price breaks below Support 1.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">‣ Support 4 at $0.00000806 is the last line of defence if things continue to unravel.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">‣ For now, LDO is stuck in neutral, and any move above Resistance 1 would be a sign that the token is ready for a breakout. But without a catalyst, the market seems hesitant to push LDO higher.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="ql-size-large">What’s Driving LDO’s Struggles?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A lot of LDO’s price action can be traced back to macroeconomic factors and internal developments within Lido Finance. One of the biggest hits came when Lido decided to pull the plug on its Solana service between October and November 2023. This move likely contributed to the rough start for LDO in 2024. Despite this setback, Lido’s Total Value Locked (TVL) surged by $420 million to $21.6 billion, driven by increased ETH staking.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But then, in January 2024, Lido saw a 76% drop in liquidity incentives across all chains, leading investors to look elsewhere for staking opportunities. While Lido kept pulling in staked ETH, with a net inflow of 229,918 staked ETH in June, it wasn’t enough to reverse LDO’s broader price trend.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bitcoin’s ETF approval and halving event in April 2024 also shifted market sentiment heavily in Bitcoin’s favour, pulling liquidity away from Ethereum and its ecosystem. As Bitcoin soared, Ethereum—and by extension, Lido—struggled to maintain momentum. LDO’s revenue took a hit as demand for Ethereum staking dropped, dragging the token’s price down further.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On the bright side, Q3 saw some positive developments for Lido, including Fireblocks integrating Lido’s staking middleware. While institutional interest in Lido is growing, the broader market’s focus on Bitcoin continues to challenge LDO’s ability to rebound.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice.</em></p>',

Within hours, the altcoin market cap dropped from $592.656B to $583.99B, shaking traders out of their calm. Investors saw the jobless claims spike as a sign of economic slowdown, and in the altcoin space, that kind of fear spreads quickly.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yet, despite the tumble, the broader crypto market is showing resilience. The TOTAL3 chart excludes BTC and ETH and has held steady, buoyed by strong support levels and technical indicators like the RSI. With global uncertainty still in play—such as Israel-Iran tensions and questions around China’s stimulus—the market remains on edge. While the Fed’s rate cuts may push liquidity into crypto, until the macroeconomic picture clears up, expect volatility. Investors are cautiously optimistic, but as this week’s data shows, nothing is set in stone.</span></p><p class="ql-align-center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleuserraw_analysis.com/docsz/AD_4nXfSSy-SSRufJu1rzvBaa5SQ6Hdp9sslU1F0uxEQ5GbbAXPWAvtA33nOpWMQeAsO6Ot_2RlJ9XHI9lCAFH7vF9lrMcXPlBhXx1H0HDMy1Q6pr2fkpQaYRX3sqzTv5DjN6M-36-ANwC9TDYpdlrV6JuX9HVU?key=UgOvfKnBirSCN_r98OOFaQ" height="272"></span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="ql-size-large">Is TOTAL3 Gearing Up for a Big Move?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite the recent altcoin dip, TOTAL3 looks like it’s gearing up for a breakout. After cracking through a downward trendline and retesting it as support, key moving averages (20, 50, and 100-day) are aligning in their favour. With the market cap hovering around $613 billion, the charts point to a potential move toward the $650 billion mark. Volume is steady, and an RSI of 57.67 suggests there’s still room to run. The reaction zone between $450 and $550 billion has proven its strength, setting TOTAL3 up for more gains.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But it’s not just about the charts. Macroeconomic factors are also in play. The Fed’s September rate cuts have created a risk-on environment, encouraging investment in cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions, particularly between Israel and Iran, add uncertainty, though crypto often benefits from instability. With strong U.S. employment metrics and the potential liquidity boost from China’s stimulus package, the backdrop remains supportive. TOTAL3 seems poised for a big move—provided the external environment cooperates.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><em style="color: rgb(29, 28, 29);">AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice.</em></p>',

But there’s still strong support around, with the trendline and moving averages (20-day and 50-day) doing their job, preventing any big dips.

But global uncertainty—especially the ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran—is keeping things volatile. Meanwhile, China’s on-again-off-again stimulus could add more fuel to the fire if and when it kicks in. The unemployment claims coming in higher than expected (258K vs. 231K) sent altcoins into a mini freefall, with the market shedding a few billion.

      '<p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-huge" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hedge Funds Are Warming to Crypto—But What Does That Mean for the Market?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Nearly half of traditional hedge funds are now dipping their toes into the crypto waters, according to a recent report from AIMA and PwC. That’s a significant leap from last year when only 29% were involved. But this isn’t just about Bitcoin and Ethereum anymore. Hedge funds are exploring a wider slice of the crypto pie, though they’re doing it with a careful, calculated approach.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So, why the sudden interest? Is this just a case of hedge funds feeling the FOMO, or is there something more substantial here? Turns out, it’s a bit of both. Hedge funds chase returns, and crypto\'s volatility presents a clear opportunity. But they’re also recognizing the maturation of the market, with more regulation, better infrastructure, and increasing institutional involvement giving it more credibility than ever.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Institutional Adoption—Is This the Start?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The rising hedge fund participation in crypto is undeniably a good sign for the industry. Institutional players bring credibility, and their involvement suggests that digital assets are slowly becoming part of the mainstream financial conversation. But let’s not get carried away—hedge funds aren’t diving in headfirst. Most are allocating a small percentage of their portfolios to crypto, using it as either a hedge or a speculative bet. They\'re not exactly loading up the truck with Bitcoin.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This cautious approach highlights a key point: hedge funds see potential, but they’re still wary of the regulatory risks and market volatility that come with crypto. So, while this could be a precursor to full-blown institutional adoption, we’re not quite there yet.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What Does This Mean for Crypto?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On one hand, more institutional money means greater liquidity and less volatility—at least in theory. Hedge funds tend to smooth out the wild price swings that retail traders often cause. On the other hand, these big players also have the resources to move quickly in and out of positions, which could lead to even more volatility during market stress.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">And let’s not forget about regulation. As more hedge funds and institutional players enter the space, there will likely be louder calls for clear, robust regulatory frameworks. That could help attract more institutional capital, but it may also bring the kind of oversight that hardcore crypto purists have been trying to avoid.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Are We Heading Toward a New Bull Run?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The data is encouraging, but let’s not jump the gun. Hedge funds are starting to pay more attention to crypto, but the overall market share of institutional capital in digital assets remains relatively small. And with central banks still wrestling with inflation and interest rates, the macroeconomic environment remains shaky. Crypto is still seen as a risk asset, and turbulence in traditional markets could easily spill over into the crypto space.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In short, hedge funds are getting comfortable with crypto, but we’re not on the verge of an institutional takeover just yet. For now, they’re cautiously optimistic—dipping their toes into the water rather than diving in. It’s a step forward, but don’t expect a full-blown bull run just because hedge funds are starting to play the game.</span></p>',

After the Fed minutes pushed the S&amp;P500 to a new all-time high, inflation data (the good old Consumer Price Index) for September dropped. The numbers? Monthly inflation ticked up by 0.2%, just a smidge higher than the 0.1% expected, and annual inflation hit 2.4%, slightly above the forecast of 2.3%. Still, nothing to lose sleep over—it’s down from 2.5% last month, so it’s not exactly a red flag.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But wait, there’s more. Unemployment claims were a bit higher than the 231k expected, landing at 258k. That\'s not ideal, especially in this climate. These numbers rattled both the S&amp;P500 and Bitcoin, sparking some early bearish volatility in the New York session, showing just how sensitive markets are to data releases.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="ql-size-large">What’s Next for the S&amp;P500?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Now, if you’ve been keeping up with our reports, we’ve said inflation below 3% isn’t a huge deal. But weak employment numbers? That could trigger some downside or at least a bit of a market shake-up, like the dip we saw this morning. The good news? September’s unemployment rate came in pretty solid, so the macroeconomic outlook still leans positive.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For the S&amp;P500, things were bearish at the start of the session, but it rebounded nicely, popping back above $5800 by midday. If it breaks through the all-time high of $5807, we’re looking at a shot at $5824—right where the 1.61 Fibonacci level from early September sits. Keep an eye on $5840, too, where the 1.27 Fibonacci level from the mid-July high is hanging out. Basically, watch your trades around the $5800 range—it’s primetime for potential reversals.</span></p><p class="ql-align-center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleuserraw_analysis.com/docsz/AD_4nXcDPA0naHVr8oGaB5jSvuuTg_xYbBS-VWec3oI53gLWysU_KL472knOkLCxLiTQkUkKLThuPYIqFizQP5jnK92Bor5URz0frhxeOWGYKu84SLQ74c5hACtWXUy46DIuCp_HyXFUTTvZqtfrIWa_d_wx7SGr?key=uOTLsD40D3AyZXi57VaYpg" height="287"></span></p><p class="ql-align-center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="ql-size-small">S&amp;P500 4H Chart</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="ql-size-large">What’s Going On with Bitcoin?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Now, Bitcoin. Oh, Bitcoin. It’s got all these bullish macro indicators floating around, but the price action? Not exactly inspiring. It’s weak, dragging the rest of the altcoin market down with it. And today’s higher-than-expected unemployment claims are just adding to that bearish vibe.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After digesting the news about labour market weakness and a bump in inflation (even though it’s down from last month), Bitcoin has broken its critical support level at $60k. If it closes below that with a daily candle, brace yourself—$58k could be on the horizon. The 58k to 55.6k range is a reversal zone from the last low, so if we get there, it’ll be the strongest support in the short term.</span></p><p class="ql-align-center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleuserraw_analysis.com/docsz/AD_4nXcpXwui8xfTaQsMkbGnxeoJaGKdlxF86XUN54cuSfA70InOebq1__-RqxJQXo9K74d2-5mDWdbQnbTKZ-v69dfwW-C4jLYQPOAXgqdQABMSvcy_BFjw8Xz08QkaeYpIDA0Qg49Qr_JiC8fsRyEeuS_Ikxj1?key=uOTLsD40D3AyZXi57VaYpg" height="253"></span></p><p class="ql-align-center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="ql-size-small">BTC 4H Chart</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="ql-size-large">What is left for the market?</strong></p><ol><li class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The news about Unemployment Claims and CPI, both not great for the economy, have surprisingly left the S&amp;P500 unfazed—for now.</span></li><li class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bitcoin, on the other hand, hasn’t taken it so well, sliding down to 59k.</span></li><li class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If this downtrend in BTC keeps up, we might see it touch 58k soon.</span></li><li class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Stay cautious—it’s a wild market out there, especially if you’re playing with leverage.</span></li></ol><p class="ql-align-justify"><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice.</em></p>',

      '<p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-huge" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Thailand’s SEC Greenlights Bitcoin for Private Funds: What It Means for Crypto in Asia</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In a significant move for both Bitcoin and institutional adoption, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed new regulations allowing private funds to invest in cryptocurrencies. For those in the crypto space, this is more than just another sign of institutional interest—it’s a signal that Asia, particularly Thailand, is positioning itself as a major player in the future of digital assets.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But why is this development important, and what does it mean for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market? Let’s break it down.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Thailand’s SEC: Opening the Door to Institutional Bitcoin</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Thailand’s SEC has taken a notable step forward by allowing private funds to allocate capital to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Private funds, which cater to high-net-worth individuals and institutions, typically have more flexibility in their investment strategies compared to public funds. By giving these funds the green light to explore digital assets, Thailand is signaling a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as part of a sophisticated portfolio strategy.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This is significant because, until now, Thailand’s approach to crypto has been cautious, focused mainly on consumer protection. The shift to include private funds indicates a growing comfort with Bitcoin’s place in the financial ecosystem, legitimizing it as an investable asset within a regulated framework.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Why Private Funds? A Step Toward Institutional Adoption</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Private funds are where institutional investors often play, and this proposal sends a clear message: Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset for retail traders. It’s becoming a legitimate tool for portfolio diversification, even for risk-averse, institutional players. This move could attract more capital to the market, bringing liquidity and potentially stabilizing Bitcoin’s notorious price swings.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, the real impact will depend on how much these private funds decide to invest. Many may start cautiously, allocating only a small percentage to crypto while keeping an eye on regulatory and market developments. But even these incremental moves are a strong signal of Bitcoin’s maturation.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Asian Context: Why Thailand Matters</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Thailand’s decision is not happening in isolation. Asia has been a critical region for crypto, with countries like Japan and South Korea already embracing digital assets, while others like China have taken a more restrictive approach. By allowing private funds to invest in Bitcoin, Thailand is placing itself on the progressive end of the regulatory spectrum, alongside countries like Singapore that are actively fostering a crypto-friendly environment.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This is a strategic move. Asia has a tech-savvy population and a growing interest in alternative financial systems, especially in regions where traditional financial infrastructure may be lacking or where inflation concerns are pushing people toward store-of-value assets like Bitcoin. If Thailand’s regulatory framework proves successful, it could serve as a model for other Southeast Asian nations, accelerating institutional crypto adoption across the region.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What This Means for Bitcoin</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Institutional interest is often seen as a key driver for Bitcoin’s long-term growth, and Thailand’s proposal could be a step in that direction. By enabling private funds to invest in crypto, the SEC is opening the door to more stable, institutional capital, which could help smooth out some of Bitcoin’s price volatility. More liquidity also means a healthier, more resilient market.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, with greater institutional participation comes the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As hedge funds and private funds dive into the market, there will be calls for clearer regulations to protect large-scale investors. This could bring more stability but might also lead to stricter rules—something crypto purists may not appreciate.</span></p>',

Now, 100 isn’t just a round number that looks neat on a chart. It’s also where the lower edge of the index’s long-term uptrend sits—a trend that’s been going strong since 2011. Back then, the dollar started doing this thing where it kept making higher lows, like some kind of financial pogo stick, bouncing along, showing the world it’s still got stamina.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="ql-size-large">What Does This Say About the US Dollar?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This ongoing trend tells a bigger story: global confidence in the US dollar isn’t fading. In fact, it’s growing. People are still betting that the US economy can pay its bills, and the dollar remains the go-to currency for global transactions and a safe haven during crises. As the dollar rises, other currencies—well, they’re kind of fading into the background. Sorry, euro.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Normally, the DXY and the stock market have this indirect, push-pull relationship—when one goes up, the other tends to go down. But lately, they’ve been dancing to the same tune. Since September 18th, the S&amp;P500 has hit new highs, while the DXY has also been on the rise. What’s going on? Well, the dollar’s strength still seems to be holding up, even in the face of rate cuts, thanks to solid employment numbers. People still like what the dollar represents—stability.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="ql-size-large">What’s Next for the DXY?</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since bouncing off the historical 100 support level after the September 18th rate cut announcement, the DXY has climbed back up to the 102.6-102.8 range. That happens to be the 0.23 Fibonacci level from its 2022 high. If it can break through that resistance, the next stop could be around 103.5. So, keep an eye on that level—it could tell us if the dollar’s about to get another boost.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice.</em></p>',

      'Is Ethereum Slipping? Bitcoin Dominance Rises AgainETH/BTC Pair: Stuck in a Downward Spiral?ETH/BTC1D ChartEthereum vs. Bitcoin. It’s the classic crypto heavyweight battle, and right now, ETH is getting pushed down the stairs. The ETH/BTC pair has been sliding since it hit that 0.041 resistance mark, right where the 0.23 Fibonacci retracement level from 2018 sits. You know those long-term Fibonacci levels—sometimes they seem like magic. They can really help spot those key areas where prices either find support to push higher or bounce lower. And right now? It’s looking like a bounce lower.Why ETH Is Struggling Against BTCSince March, ETH/BTC has been on a steady downward path. It first ran into trouble at 0.0575, another Fibonacci level (this time 0.38 from 2018), and since then, Bitcoin’s been flexing its muscles. With the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, BTC has been acting more like a stock, closely following the S&P500. Plus, Bitcoin dominance has surged, currently sitting around 58%. That’s bad news for all the altcoin pairs with BTC, including ETH.Now, here’s the thing: 0.038 is the support level to watch. If it cracks, ETH/BTC could head all the way down to 0.0316. That’s where we find the bottom of this bearish channel it’s been stuck in, and also the lower end of the reversal zone from its 2021 high when the pair made a clear top. In other words, things could get even worse for ETH if that support doesn’t hold.AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice.',

      'Bitcoin vs. Bonds: Will Rising Yields Steal the Show?What’s the Deal with the 10Y Bond Yield?So, here’s the thing with Bitcoin lately—it’s been kind of sluggish, which is not what you’d expect when the S&P500 is hitting new highs. You’d think Bitcoin would be tagging along for the ride, but no. What happened? Well, part of it has to do with the 10-year bond auction that went down on Wednesday. The yield came in at 4.07%, which is the first time we’ve seen it break 4% since July. Big deal, right?The 10-year US Treasury bond is a bit like the thermometer for the economy. It measures how hot or cold things are going to be, and right now, it’s creeping back up. Bond yields like this one are auctioned off, and when the yield goes up while inflation is chilling around 2.5%, it usually means investors are seeing storm clouds ahead. Economic risks? Check. Less liquidity? Also, check. And that’s bad news for Bitcoin because, in an environment like this, people tend to get cosy with safe assets—like bonds—instead of rolling the dice with crypto.Why Are 10Y Bonds a Big Deal for Bitcoin?Here’s why the 10-year bond is the one to watch. When its yield is low, investors start looking for higher returns elsewhere, and that’s when risky assets like Bitcoin start looking pretty good. But, if the 10-year yield keeps rising, it’s like a magnet for all that investor cash. Suddenly, Bitcoin’s “alternative asset” appeal gets a bit of a hit. And since we’re seeing bond yields break out of their downtrend, Bitcoin might be in for a tougher time.The 10-year yield is now sitting above 4%, a level it last fell below in August when the Jobless Claims report spooked everyone. If the yield keeps climbing, the next resistance is between 4.3% and 4.5%. For the markets to stay in “Risk On” mode—where risky assets like Bitcoin benefit—we need those levels to hold. If not, investors might start heading for the exits.US-10Y & BTC 4H ChartWhy Is Bitcoin Falling Despite Stock Market Gains?It’s kind of weird, though. Bitcoin has been bearish all week, even as the S&P500 hit an all-time high near $5800. Historically, Bitcoin tends to get a boost when stocks do well, but it seems like bonds might be throwing a wrench in that correlation. Rising yields can siphon off liquidity, leaving less room for assets like Bitcoin to thrive. Safe haven assets like bonds are taking the spotlight, while crypto is left waiting for its turn.What is left for the market?The 10Y bond auction yield hit 4.07% with 2.5% inflation, signalling investors aren’t rushing to grab government debt.Bitcoin is looking weak while the stock market is out here setting fresh highs—it’s not following the usual script.If bond yields keep climbing, don’t be surprised if riskier assets like Bitcoin take a hit as investors seek safer returns.Stay cautious—it’s a wild market out there, especially if you’re playing with leverage. AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice.',
